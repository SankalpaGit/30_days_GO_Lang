<h1>What is Go?</h1>

        - Go was developed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson in 2007 <br>
        - Go is a cross-platform, open source programming language<br>
        - Go can be used to create high-performance applications<br>
        - Go is a fast, statically typed, compiled language known for its simplicity and efficiency<br>
        - Go's syntax is similar to C++


<h1>What is Go Used For?</h1>

    You can use go lang for the following purposes:
        - Web development (server-side)
        - Network-based programs
        - Cross-platform enterprise applications
        - Cloud-native development

<h1>Syntax in Go Lang</h1>

    A Go file consists of the following parts:
        - Package declaration
        - Import packages
        - Functions
        - Statements and expressions

<H1> Types of the print statement in Go</H1>

        - print: Normal print and it prints its arguments with their default format.
        - printf: a whitespace is added between the arguments, and a newline is added at the end
        - println: formats its argument based on the given formatting verb and then prints them.

<H1>Understand the variable assignments </H1>

        - if we do day1:= "Sunday" the compiler automatically assign the type according to it undestanding
        - for declaring variable data type by self use var name and dtypev = valuename
        - Like othe programming language Go also have data types like string,integer float as float32 also boolean value.

<H1>Go variable naming rules: </H1>

        - A variable name must start with a letter or an underscore
        - A variable name cannot start with a digit
        - A variable name cannot contain spaces
        - The variable name cannot be any Go keywords


If a variable should have a fixed value that cannot be changed, you can use the const keyword.<br>
The const keyword declares the variable as "constant", which means that it is unchangeable and read-only.

<h1>Type of the const keyword</h1>

        - Typed Const: where the dataype is declaare for the const variable.
        - UnTyped Const: where the dataype is not declaare for the const variable.

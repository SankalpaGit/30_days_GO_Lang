<H1>Understand the variable assignments </H1>
        <li>if we do day1:= "Sunday" the compiler automatically assign the type according to it undestanding</li>
        <li>for declaring variable data type by self use var name and dtypev = valuename </li>

<H3> Like othe programming language Go also have data types like string integer float as float32 also boolean value. </H3>

<H1>Go variable naming rules: </H1>
    <li> A variable name must start with a letter or an underscore </li>
    <li>A variable name cannot start with a digit</li>
    <li>A variable name cannot contain spaces</li>
    <li>The variable name cannot be any Go keywords</li>


If a variable should have a fixed value that cannot be changed, you can use the const keyword.
The const keyword declares the variable as "constant", which means that it is unchangeable and read-only.
<h3>Type of the const keyword</h3>
    <li> Typed Const: where the dataype is declaare for the const variable</li>
    <li> UnTyped Const: where the dataype is not declaare for the const variable</li>
